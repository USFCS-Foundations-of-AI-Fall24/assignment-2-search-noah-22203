Question 1:
    BFS:
        time complexity: O(b^(d+1))
        space complexity: Same as time complexity
        complete? Yes
        optimal? Yes
    UCS:
        time complexity: O(b^(1+C/E))    C = optimal cost   E = each step to get closer to the goal node
        space complexity: Same as time complexity
        complete? Yes
        optimal? Yes
    DFS:
        time complexity:  O(b^n)
        space complexity: O(bn)
        complete? Yes on a finite graph
        optimal? No
    DLS:
        time complexity: O(b^l)  
        space complexity: O(bl)
        complete? Yes
        optimal? No
    IDS:
        time complexity:  O(b^d)
        space complexity: O(bd)
        complete? Yes
        optimal? Yes
    A*:
        time complexity: O(b^d)
        space complexity: f = g(n) + h(n) 
        complete? Yes
        optimal? Yes


Question 2:
    bfs states: 36
    dfs states: 27
    dls states(limit 9): 27
    ids states: 124

    after decomposition
    bfs states: 18
    dfs states: 27(not sure why this was the same)
    dls states(limit = number of actions for each stage of decomp): 16
    ids states: 31

Question 3: (running both from location = 3,6)
    a* states: 27
    uniform cost states: 48


Question 4: 
    Antenna 1: f2
    Antenna 2: f1
    Antenna 3: f3
    Antenna 4: f3
    Antenna 5: f2
    Antenna 6: f2
    Antenna 7: f1
    Antenna 8: f3
    Antenna 9: f1

Question 5:
