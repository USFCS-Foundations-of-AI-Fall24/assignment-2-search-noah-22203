Question 1: Algorithms. 10/10

Question 2:

eq: 5/5

goal: 5/5

BFS/DFS: 5/5

DLS: 8/10 - the way you're handling the limit is a little weird.
It's easier to just store depth in each node, then the new node's depth
is parent + 1.

tools: 10/10

decomposition: 10/10

Question 3:

read_mars_graph: 4/5
Don't hardcode the path on your local machine :-) 

A*: 15/15

count states: 5/5

Question 4: 10/10

Question 5: 10/10 - good, but brief. Please feel free to expand further on
future questions.
